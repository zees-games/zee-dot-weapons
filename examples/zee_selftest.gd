## The headless suite. Run it before believing anything in this repository.
##
## [b]It counts two things, and the second is the one that catches what the first
## cannot.[/b] Sections entered against sections that ran to their last line, and a total
## number of checks. A script error aborts the section it is in and nothing else, and the
## section counter is already satisfied because the section announced itself on the way
## in — so a suite counting only sections reports "12 sections, 0 failed" while eight
## checks never ran. Another project in this family shipped exactly that.
##
## [b]What it cannot see.[/b] Everything about how the weapons look. Whether the sniper
## is held at the right angle, whether the reload reads as a reload, whether the arms are
## in front of the gun rather than through it — no assertion reaches any of that, and
## four bugs in this family were found by looking at a picture that every check had
## passed. `tools/screenshot.sh` is the other half of the test suite and is not optional.

# No CHANNEL: a suite's verdict is its output, and it prints it; it is not a log record.

## Every check this suite makes. A script error aborts the section it is in, and a section
## that aborts after its last `_check` still counts as finished; only a total can see the
## checks that never ran. It was counted and compared with nothing until 2026-09-24.

## [b]A SERVER rig has to know who is carrying it, and for a long time it did not.[/b]
##
## `player_ref` was resolved inside `_resolve_presentation()`, behind that function's
## `role == SERVER` early return. The view model and the world model belong there — they
## are drawing, and a server draws nothing. The player does not: it is where
## [method DotWeaponPlayerBridge.context_for] takes the muzzle position and the aim
## direction from, so a rig that skipped it built every [DotWeaponContext] with the
## defaults, and every shot on every dedicated server came out of `(0, 0, 0)` pointing
## `(0, 0, -1)`.
##
## **Nothing reported it, and the 133 checks above could not.** The weapon fires, the
## ammunition goes down, the use counter increments and replicates, and the hit
## registration runs and finds nothing, because there is nothing where it looked. What a
## game built on this has is a fight in which nobody can be shot and every number about it
## is correct.
##
## It was found in a game, by running bots against each other for twenty rounds: every
## single round ended with exactly two players alive, one per side, a draw. A number that is
## identical every round is a number nothing is deciding.
##
## The carrier here is a bare [Node3D] with no `component` method, so the bridge falls all
## the way through to the body transform — which is the weakest of its three answers and is
## the right one to test against, because it is the only one every game has.
