#
# A contact sheet is eighteen frames of one weapon on one image: hip, aimed, fire frames
# 1/2/4/8/14, reload at 0/25/50/75/90%, walking, turning, the draw at 30/70%, standing in a
# roof's shadow, and aimed four frames after a shot. The view
# model is stepped at a fixed 60 fps by the range (`--sheet`), so the same frame is the same
# picture every run, and a before and an after can be compared side by side.
#
#   EXTRA="--no-arms 1" tools/screenshot.sh rifle  # weapon only, no hands
#
# EXTRA is passed straight through to the range. `--no-arms` is the one that earns
# its keep: an arm drawn wrongly and a weapon drawn wrongly look identical in a
# screenshot until one of them is switched off.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Everything about a view model is motion and placement, and no assertion reaches
# either. `examples/zee_selftest.tscn` proves all twenty-seven weapons load, measure
# and simulate, and not one of its checks can tell you that a weapon is held at the
# wrong angle, that an arm is inside the gun, or that the muzzle is at the stock.
# A picture can, and this is how a machine with no screen produces one.
#
# It is NOT `--headless`. Godot's headless display driver does no rendering at all, so
# a capture under it is a black PNG — which is worse than no screenshot, because it
# looks like one. This runs the real renderer against an Xvfb framebuffer, with Mesa's
# llvmpipe standing in for a GPU.
#
# What it cannot tell you: input feel, frame pacing, and anything a real GPU driver
# does differently. Use it for "is this drawn correctly", never for "does this run
# well".
