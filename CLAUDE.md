# zee-dot-weapons

A weapons pack for the Dot family. Read `../../CLAUDE.md` first for the family-wide rules — no autoloads, `DotResult` for anything fallible, ticks rather than seconds, `DotNodeRef` rather than a scene path, everything logged through `DotLog`. This file is only what is specific to this repository.

**This one is not in the `modcommunity` organisation**, and neither is any game any more: the addons are the organisation's and the games are their author's. Its `origin` is `git@github.com:gamemann/zee-dot-weapons.git`. Everything else about it — the layout, the conventions, the two-step check, `push-github.sh` — is the same as the rest of the tree.

## The one idea

**dot-weapon decides that a use happened and refuses to draw anything. This is the half that draws.**

That refusal is dot-weapon being right: a dedicated server resolving thirty carriers must never need a mesh, and a `DotWeaponDef` that carried one could not be validated at boot by a server with no content installed. But it leaves a real gap — a weapon nobody can see — and every game that adopted dot-weapon has been filling that gap privately and differently.

So the split here is the same split, one level out. `ZeeWeaponPack` is documents a server validates; `ZeeWeaponArtTable` is filenames a client loads; and **a headless build never touches the second one**. If `ZeeModelCache` is ever reached in a headless run, something has asked a simulation question of the art layer.

## The prefix is `Zee`, not `Dot`

`class_name` is global in Godot and these addons install side by side. `Dot` is the family's namespace and this is a third-party pack that sits on top of it, so it takes its own. A pack that squatted on `DotWeaponArt` would collide the first time dot-weapon grew one.

## Weapons are named by role, never by model

`blaster-a` through `blaster-r` is the order Kenney exported them in. It is not a name, it means nothing to a player, a server console or a loadout document, and a game that swapped the art would find every rule in it pointing at the wrong file.

So `ZeeWeaponIds` names roles — `SNIPER`, `DRUM_SHOTGUN`, `BEAMER` — and `ZeeWeaponArtTable` is the **only** file in the repository that contains a filename. Replacing the art is replacing one table.

**The roles were assigned from measurements, not from filenames.** Every model was measured — length, width, height — and given the role its silhouette can carry: the two widest short models became the revolver and the drum shotgun because width reads as a cylinder, the slimmest became the beam weapon, the 1.39 m one became the sniper, the 0.42 m one became the derringer. Assigning eighteen roles from `-a` to `-r` would have been a coin flip eighteen times.

## The muzzle is measured, never written down

`ZeeModelCache.muzzle_distance()` takes the far end of the mesh's own bounding box along its forward axis. The alternative is eighteen hand-authored offsets, which is eighteen chances to be quietly wrong — and one of them *would* have been: `blaster-e` is the only model in the kit whose origin sits at the stock rather than at its centre, so the offset correct for the other seventeen puts its muzzle somewhere behind the player's ear.

**The muzzle is for effects only.** A shot's real origin is the player's eye, decided by the server. Using the muzzle transform as a shot origin would make a weapon's reach depend on its model, and would make a player with the view model turned off shoot from somewhere else.

## Orientation, and the three ways it goes wrong

`ZeeWeaponArt.model_forward` states which way a mesh points and `orientation()` derives the rotation that fixes it. Stating both would let them drift, which is how a weapon ends up pointing backwards in the world and forwards on the screen.

The blasters point along **+Z** and Godot's forward is **-Z**. The melee models and the grenades point along **+Y**, standing on their handle with the origin exactly where a hand grips them.

Three traps, all of which were hit here:

1. **The reversed case must be handled before the general one.** Two opposite vectors have a zero cross product, so the general axis-angle formula produces a basis full of `NaN` — and a `NaN` transform draws nothing at all, with no error anywhere.
2. **A melee weapon must not also carry a `world_rotation` of -90.** `model_forward` has already turned +Y onto -Z by then, so the second rotation puts the blade through the floor. The rack render caught it: six melee weapons drawn end-on as specks.
3. **A per-model offset correction has to be scaled with the model.** The sniper's pull-back is a distance along a mesh drawn at 40% in first person; applied flat it pulled four times too far and put the stock 16 cm from the eye.

## The alt-fire is not a fork

dot-weapon's arsenal routes exactly one button into a behaviour, and that is the arsenal being right rather than incomplete — an alt-fire is a second state machine with its own cadence and its own refusals, and folding it in would make every game built on dot-weapon pay for a feature most of them do not have.

So the bash lives in `ZeeWeaponBash` and its state machine lives in `ZeeWeaponRig`, which owns the cooldown, puts it in the snapshot and rolls it back with everything else. **The addon is not forked.** That is the extension point working.

## What the rig counts, and why it counts it

The arsenal knows exactly how far through a reload it is and keeps it private. That is correct: exposing a fraction would make an animation's needs part of a simulation's public interface, and the next game to want a different animation would want a different fraction.

So the rig listens to the signals the arsenal *does* emit and counts the ticks itself. Two things about that are not obvious:

- **`switched` fires between the holster and the deploy, not at the start of the holster.** A rig that waited for it draws the weapon at rest for the whole way down. The holster half is noticed by watching `is_switching()` go true, before the arsenal runs.
- **The previous command's buttons are simulation state and belong in the snapshot.** The bash, the reload and every semi-automatic weapon are edge-triggered against it. The arsenal does not have this problem because it is *handed* the previous command; the rig keeps one, so the rig has to save it. Left out, a restored rig thinks the alt-fire button was already down and silently refuses the next press, exactly once. The suite's rollback section is what found it.

## Presentation is never part of the netcode contract

`ZeeWeaponPose` runs on render frames, reads a delta in seconds, and never writes to anything the simulation reads. A player with the view model switched off simulates identically to one who has not. That is the line dot-player-controller draws between its motor and its view, drawn again in the same place.

Two consequences worth keeping:

- **Everything the pose is handed is clamped and checked for finiteness.** One `NaN` reaching a `Transform3D` makes the weapon vanish with no error anywhere, and it presents as "the view model broke".
- **The recoil spring is critically damped and solved exactly, and both integrators were tried first.** Explicit Euler adds energy at every step, so a spring that should settle grows instead; it takes a few seconds of held automatic fire to become obvious and reads as a tuning problem rather than an integration one. Semi-implicit Euler fixed that and, at the stiffness the recoil now runs at, brought two quieter faults: it is unstable past w·dt ≈ 2, which a 10 fps frame is, and under critical damping it bled about a third of every kick away in its first step, so the climb asked for was never the climb drawn. The closed form has neither. There is a section in the suite that holds the trigger for thirty seconds, and one that asserts the climb drawn at 144 fps and at 30 is the climb asked for.

## Recoil, and what was wrong with it

Reported on 2026-10-05 as "very bad", and measured before anything was changed (one shot, at the weapon's real weight and recoil):

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| minigun / smg | 0.6° / 0.6° | 0.5° / 0.9° |
| sniper | **17.0° and 13 cm back** | 5.7° and 4.5 cm |
| hardest ÷ softest | 28 | 11 |
| sideways | always the same way | either way |
| the camera | never moved | `view_punch()`, 30% of the climb |

Four faults, each its own line in `ZeeWeaponPose`:

- **Weight multiplied the kick a second time.** A behaviour's `recoil_pitch` already says how hard a weapon kicks; scaling it by `ZeeWeaponArt.weight` as well counted the sniper's size twice. Weight now slows the spring (by its square root) and scales sway and bob, and does not touch the size of a kick.
- **The range was linear.** Recoil runs 0.12 to 4.0 across the pack, which is right for a camera climbing and wrong for a gun in a hand. `kick_degrees()` compresses it: `kick_pitch · r / (1 + r · kick_knee)`.
- **The gun turned about the eye.** `Animated` sits at the camera, so a rotation there carried the whole weapon up the screen instead of tipping the muzzle. `pivot` is the holder's rest origin, which is the grip, and the kick turns about that.
- **The yaw had no sign.** Every behaviour hands over a positive `recoil_yaw`, and it was applied as given. `punch()` picks a side per shot.

**The camera's half is the game's to apply**, through `rig.view_punch()`. The view model is a child of the camera, and every controller in this family writes the camera's angles from scratch each frame, so anything the pack added there was overwritten before it was drawn. dot-player-controller's `DotFpsView.external_angles` was added for it (beside `external_offset`, for the same reason); mg-smash-copter adds it on its own camera line. It is never added to a command: the shot went where the command pointed.

## A shot is seen and heard, and was neither

Reported on 2026-10-05 as "doesn't shoot any bullets, and no sounds". Both were true of every game on the pack: the rig decided the use, the ammunition went down, the server resolved the hit, and the only thing a player saw was the gun kick. `ZeeViewModel.model_ready` said a game could hang a muzzle flash off it, and no game did. "The half that draws" drew the gun and stopped.

`ZeeShotFx` is the rest: a tracer, a flash with a light, a spark and a puff on what was hit, and a report from `ZeeWeaponSound`. Four decisions in it, each the obvious alternative being wrong:

- **The tracer ends where a presentation raycast from the eye says, not where the server's hit registration did.** A client does not know what lag-compensated hitboxes decided and must not wait to be told. It is traced from the eye (where the shot really started) and drawn from the muzzle (where the picture should leave).
- **Tracers and impacts are sized by distance from the camera.** A tracer is seen almost end-on, and 2 cm at 30 m is one pixel; the first render showed a sniper shot as a yellow fleck.
- **The billboards need a texture and `billboard_keep_scale`.** A quad with no texture is a square of light, and a billboard ignores its node's scale without the flag; the first flash was a pale square a tenth of the screen across.
- **A world model whose carrier has a first-person rig with effects stays quiet** (`_carrier_draws_its_own`). game-playground drives every player's world model from the replicated counter, its own player's included, which is the simplest way to write it, and would otherwise hear every one of its own shots twice.

**The sounds are baked, because there is no CC0 set of twenty-seven matched weapon reports to vendor.** dot-audio's synthesiser is one sine sweep with unfiltered noise and three shot voices, which is right for a placeholder of anything and wrong for twenty-seven weapons that should be told apart; `ZeeWeaponSound` layers a band-passed crack, a swept body and a low-passed tail per class, deterministically, so the suite can assert about the bytes. `set_stream(id_or_class, stream)` puts a recording in front of it one weapon at a time.

**Rendering found that the range had been shooting from the world origin for as long as it existed.** Its rig has no `player_ref` (the range's player is a bare body the player bridge cannot read), so every shot came out of (0, 0, 0) along -Z — `_resolve_carrier`'s server bug, in the example. Its hit marks landed where a player aiming straight ahead expected, because the targets stand on that axis. The first tracer ran from the gun to the floor under the player's feet. The range hands the rig a context from the controller's eye now; the eye and not the camera, because the camera carries the punch.

`zee_range -- --weapon smg --fire --capture <prefix>` is how a machine with no hands sees any of it: the trigger pulls itself, and six frames are saved counted from the first shot, with the clock slowed twenty times so that a software renderer's tenth-of-a-second frames are a flip-book of one shot rather than a picture of the reload after it.

## Aiming down is presentation, and the game decides the button

`ZeeViewModel.aim(held)` eases the weapon from the hip to `ZeeWeaponArt.aim_offset` over `aim_time`, steadies sway and bob by `ZeeWeaponPose.aim_steadiness`, and reports `aim_fov_scale()` (the art's `aim_zoom` at full aim) and `is_scoped()`. **It changes nothing the server simulates** — no command bit, no snapshot field — because the half of aiming that is a rule (tighter spread, slower walk) is a game's decision and belongs in its own command; this is the half that draws. The game applies the zoom to its camera (`DotFpsView.external_fov_scale`, beside `external_angles` for the same reason) and puts a `ZeeScopeOverlay` in its HUD for the scoped weapons; the view model hides the weapon and the arms through a scope, because a barrel across the bottom of a scope is a weapon held in front of the eye. Melee and throwables have `aim_enabled` off; the sniper is x0.3 and the marksman x0.5, both scoped; everything else aims at x0.8.

**Right mouse is the bash's button too**, and choosing between them is the game's (a game setting, not a fork): the pack's alt-fire is `BUTTON_ALT` in the command, the aim is a local hold. Two render bugs were found by `EXTRA="--aim" tools/screenshot.sh sniper` before anything else could have: the overlay set its anchors without its offsets and filled nothing, and the arms are the view model's own child so hiding the animated node left an arm across the scope.

**A reload is heard too** (2026-10-06): `ZeeWeaponSound.RELOAD_OUT` when the arsenal starts one and `RELOAD_IN` when it finishes, baked like the reports, played at the carrier through `ZeeShotFx.play_reload`, and announced as `ZeeWeaponRig.reload_sound`. Same rule as a report: never on a server, never on a replayed tick.

## Replication is a counter, not an event

The obvious design is an RPC per shot, and it is wrong three ways at once: it needs a reliable channel for something worthless if it arrives late, it costs a packet per shot per watcher, and it desynchronises from the state snapshot it belongs with — so a watcher can see the muzzle flash of a weapon the same snapshot says has been holstered.

A four-bit counter *inside* the snapshot cannot do any of those. A watcher who missed a snapshot sees it jump by two and plays one flash instead of two, which is the correct amount of wrong.

`uses_between()` is wrap-aware, and that is the whole reason it is a function: a plain subtraction goes negative every sixteen shots, and code that reads a negative as "nothing happened" makes a weapon go silent for one snapshot in sixteen.

## What running it in a game found

- **Every shot on every dedicated server came out of the world origin, pointing north.** `player_ref` was resolved inside `_resolve_presentation()`, behind that function's `role == SERVER` early return. The view model and the world model belong there — they are drawing, and a server draws nothing. The player does not: it is where `DotWeaponPlayerBridge.context_for` takes the muzzle position and the aim direction from, so a server rig built every `DotWeaponContext` with the defaults, `(0, 0, 0)` and `(0, 0, -1)`.

  **Nothing reported it and 133 checks could not.** The weapon fires, the ammunition goes down, the use counter increments and replicates, and the hit registration runs and finds nothing, because there is nothing where it looked. A game built on this has a fight in which nobody can be shot and every number about it is correct. It was found in mg-smash-copter by running bots against each other for twenty rounds: every single round ended with exactly two players alive, one per side, a draw. A number that is identical every round is a number nothing is deciding.

  The suite could not see it because `_make_rig()` never set a carrier — which is the shape of the gap rather than an oversight, since a test rig with no player is the easiest one to write. `_rig_carrier()` builds a SERVER rig under a positioned, rotated `Node3D` and asserts the shot leaves the carrier and goes where it faces. Both checks armed, both fire, with the original symptom verbatim.

## The art inside a delivered game

`ZeeWeaponArtTable` and `ZeeViewArms` name `res://assets/…`, and a game delivered as a dot-cloud pack has its vendored copy under `res://dot_cloud/<id>/<version>/assets/…` instead, while the client shell carries this addon and no art. Every weapon then loads invisible, with one WARN each. `ZeeModelCache.set_asset_root(root)` rewrites `res://assets/` paths under `root` at the one place every model is loaded; the table is untouched, because it must read the same in a game that builds the art in. A game sets it when it loads (game-playground: `PlaygroundPaths.root()`) and puts `res://` back when it goes, because a static outlives one game in a shell that loads the next. Found by game-playground on 2026-10-03; mg-smash-copter vendors the art the same way and sets it in `ScClient` since 2026-10-03 (mg-smash-copter eebb467). `zee_selftest`'s art section asserts `resolve` and that `scene()` loads through it (armed). A shell exported before this method existed cannot load a game that calls it.

## A second pack adds to this one

Every rig's default catalogue is `ZeeWeaponPack.catalogue()`, and every world model, figure and loot table in a game asks `ZeeWeaponArtTable` for art, so a second pack (game-zombie-zone asked for one, 2026-10-10) had two bad choices: be handed to every one of those by each game, or fork this one. `ZeeWeaponPack.add_source`, `ZeeWeaponArtTable.add_source` and `ZeeWeaponSound.set_class` are the third: a pack registers a callable once, in its own install, and `weapons()` / `all()` append what it returns. **This pack's ids win**: a source bringing `pistol` loses it with a WARN, because changing what "pistol" means on a server that had it is a change nobody asked for. The sources are statics, so they outlive a game in a shell that loads the next; a game installs a pack when it loads and removes it when it goes, as with `ZeeModelCache.set_asset_root`. The suite's "another pack adds to this one" registers a source with a new id and a clashing one and checks both rules, that `ZeeWeaponArtTable.validate()` (which refuses art for an id this pack does not define) still passes with another pack's art in the table, and the removal.

## Validating

```bash
cd godot/zee-dot-weapons

godot --headless --path . --import
find . -name '*.gd' -not -path './.godot/*' | while read f; do
    godot --headless --path . --check-only --script "res://${f#./}"
done

timeout 300 godot --headless --path . res://examples/zee_selftest.tscn
```

**20 sections, 192 checks.** The suite counts both, and the second is the one that catches what the first cannot: a script error aborts the section it is in, and the section counter is already satisfied because the section announced itself on the way in.

### And then look at it, because the suite cannot

**Everything about this pack that can be wrong is invisible to every assertion in it.** The suite proves all twenty-seven weapons load, measure, simulate, replicate and roll back. Not one of its checks can tell you that a weapon is held at the wrong angle, that an arm is drawn over the gun it is holding, that a knife is pointing directly away from the eye, or that the view model is casting a shadow on the ground.

Every one of those was a real bug here, and every one was found by rendering a frame and looking at it.

```bash
tools/screenshot.sh --rack          # all twenty-seven, with a pip on each muzzle
tools/screenshot.sh sniper          # one weapon, first person
tools/screenshot.sh --all           # one frame per weapon
```

The rack render is the sharpest of the three: each weapon gets a red pip at its measured muzzle and there are three green pips laid along Godot's forward as a reference. Every red pip must sit on the same side of its weapon as the green ones sit of the rack. That single comparison is what proved the orientation correct, and it is what would catch it breaking.

`tools/screenshot.sh` is **not** `--headless`. Godot's headless display driver does no rendering at all, so a capture under it is a black PNG — which is worse than no screenshot, because it looks like one.

## Numbers that were measured, so nobody has to measure them again

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Blasters | 18, from 0.42 m (`blaster-b`) to 1.39 m (`blaster-e`) |
| `blaster-e` | the only one whose mesh origin is at the stock rather than the centre |
| Blocky character | **2.7 m tall, 1.6 m wide** — a stylised giant, not a person |
| One arm | a 0.4 × 1.1 × 0.4 box, pivot at the shoulder, mesh hanging to `y = -1` |
| Melee tools | 0.15 m to 0.35 m tall, origin at the butt of the handle, pointing +Y |
| Target discs | modelled in the YZ plane, 0.34 m across — they need turning and scaling |
| Vendored art | 47 models, 3 textures, 1.7 MB |

The arm measurements are why `arm_scale` is 0.20 rather than 1.0: the shoulders sit about 0.35 m out and the grip about 0.45 m out, so a fifth of a metre is the distance between them. The box is 0.4 wide in its own units, so that scale sets the forearm's thickness as well as its length — 8 cm, which at a third of a metre from a 90-degree camera is about a seventh of the screen.

## Two hazards this repository walked into

Both are in `../../docs/gdscript-hazards.md` and both were hit anyway.

**A GDScript lambda captures locals by value.** A counter incremented inside a signal handler stays zero outside it. The suite's bash section did exactly this and reported a failure for a signal that had fired perfectly; worse, the rollback section beside it *passed*, because the value it was initialised with happened to be the answer it asserted. Accumulate into an `Array`, never into a captured scalar.

**A clipping plane does not hide an object, it slices it.** The first arm placement used anatomically sensible shoulders, which are behind the eye — so the shoulders sat behind the near plane and what drew was the cut face: a pale slab across the lower half of the screen that reads as a broken model. Every shoulder in `ZeeViewArms` is in front of the camera.
