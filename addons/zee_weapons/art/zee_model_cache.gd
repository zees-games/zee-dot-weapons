extends RefCounted

## Loads a weapon mesh once, measures it once, and hands out copies.
##
## [b]Why a cache at all.[/b] Thirty players holding the same rifle is thirty
## instances of one [PackedScene], not thirty loads of one file. `load()` is cached by
## the engine, so the loading half of this is a convenience; the measuring half is not,
## and that is the part that earns the file. Walking a scene tree to merge mesh bounding
## boxes costs an instantiate, and doing it every time somebody switches weapons is a
## hitch on every switch.
##
## [b]Measuring is how the muzzle is found.[/b] The alternative is a hand-authored
## offset per weapon, and eighteen hand-authored offsets are eighteen chances to be
## quietly wrong — including on `blaster-e`, whose mesh origin is at the stock rather
## than at the centre, so the offset that is correct for the other seventeen puts its
## muzzle somewhere behind the player's ear. A measurement cannot drift from the model
## it measured.
##
## [b]Nothing here is called on a dedicated server.[/b] A server resolves weapons,
## damage and hit registration without ever asking what a weapon looks like; if this
## file is reached in a headless build, something has asked a simulation question of
## the art layer.

## [b]Every path in [ZeeWeaponArtTable] and [ZeeViewArms] says `res://assets/…`, and in a
## delivered game that is the one place the art is not.[/b] The pack vendors it beside its
## own files and dot-cloud mounts those under `res://dot_cloud/<id>/<version>/`, so a
## client shell — which carries this addon and no art — resolves every weapon to nothing
## and the WARN below says "the weapon will be invisible" for all twenty-seven. The table
## is not rewritten because it is the one file that names art and must keep reading the same
## in a game that builds the art in. Called by the game when it loads, with its mount root;
## `res://` puts it back, and a game that sets it clears it when it goes, because a static
## outlives the game in a shell that switches to another one.
