extends Resource

## How one weapon looks and where it sits, in the hand and on the screen.
##
## [b]Separate from [DotWeaponDef] on purpose, and the separation is the point of this
## addon.[/b] A definition is what a server validates at boot with none of the content
## installed: a slot, a cadence, a magazine. None of that has a mesh in it, and a
## dedicated server must never need one. This resource is everything a server can
## happily not have — a model path, two offsets and a scale — and a headless build
## never loads a single one.
##
## [b]Paths, never [PackedScene] references.[/b] Same rule dot-weapon's
## [member DotWeaponDef.behaviour_path] follows and for the same reason: a game
## delivered as a dot-cloud content pack is mounted at runtime and a mounted pack's
## `class_name` globals are not registered in the host, so a preloaded resource could
## only ever ship inside the build. A path is resolved when the model is first drawn,
## by [ZeeModelCache], which is the moment the content is definitely mounted.
##
## [b]Two transforms, not one.[/b] A weapon held at arm's length in front of a camera
## and the same weapon in a character's fist are different objects at different scales:
## the first-person one is deliberately oversized and pulled close so it reads at a
## 90-degree field of view, and using one transform for both gives you either a
## world model the size of a car or a view model nobody can see.

@export_group("Identity")

## The weapon id this art belongs to. Must match a [member DotWeaponDef.id].
@export var id: StringName = &""

@export_group("Model")

## The weapon mesh. Empty is legal and means the weapon draws nothing — which is what
## bare fists are, and is why this is not required.
@export_file("*.glb", "*.gltf", "*.tscn", "*.scn") var model_path: String = ""

## Which way the mesh points in its own space, before any rotation below.
##
## [b]Kenney's blasters point along +Z and Godot's forward is -Z[/b], so every one of
## them needs turning around. Expressed as a vector rather than as a rotation baked into
## [member view_rotation] because the muzzle is derived from it too: get this wrong and
## the shots come out of the stock, which is a bug that looks like bad netcode.
@export var model_forward: Vector3 = Vector3.BACK

## Metres from the mesh origin to the muzzle, along [member model_forward].
##
## [b]Zero means "measure it", and measuring it is almost always right.[/b]
## [ZeeModelCache] takes the far end of the mesh's own bounding box along the forward
## axis, which is the end of the barrel on every model in this kit — including
## `blaster-e`, whose origin is at the stock rather than the centre and which a
## hand-written offset would therefore have had wrong. Override it only for a mesh whose
## barrel is not its longest feature.
@export_range(0.0, 4.0, 0.001, "or_greater") var muzzle_distance: float = 0.0

## Sideways and vertical nudge of the muzzle from the barrel line, in metres.

## Which way the hands hold it. Drives the arm pose, nothing else.
##
## A [StringName] rather than an enum because an enum is a list this addon would own,
## and a game adding a two-handed launcher pose should not have to edit a file here.
## [ZeeViewArms] falls back to [constant POSE_RIFLE] for a pose it does not know.
@export var pose: StringName = &"rifle"

## How much this weapon sways and bobs, as a multiple of the rig's own settings.
##
## A heavy weapon that moves exactly as much as a pistol reads as weightless. One
## number rather than a set of them, because the alternative is six sliders per weapon
## that nobody will ever tune individually.
@export_range(0.0, 3.0, 0.05) var weight: float = 1.0

@export_group("Aim")

## Whether the weapon can be aimed down at all. Off for melee and anything thrown: there is
## nothing to look along.
@export var aim_enabled: bool = true

## The field of view at full aim, as a fraction of the unaimed one. 1 aims without zooming.
##
## [b]A scale and not a field of view in degrees[/b], because the game owns the base field
## of view (a player setting, usually) and an aim that set an absolute one would zoom a
## 110-degree player less than a 70-degree one.
@export_range(0.05, 1.0, 0.01) var aim_zoom: float = 0.8

## Whether full aim looks through a scope: the model is hidden and the game draws a scope
## over the screen ([ZeeScopeOverlay]). For the long-range weapons.
@export var aim_scoped: bool = false

## Where the holder sits at full aim, in place of [member view_offset]: centred, so the
## weapon's top lines up under the crosshair. Tuned per pose like the resting place.
@export var aim_offset: Vector3 = Vector3(0.0, -0.11, -0.42)

## The weapon's rotation at full aim, in place of [member view_rotation]: straight down the
## sight, so zero. The hip hold is canted and turned to show the weapon's side, and a gun
## brought to the eye still canted is drawn end-on and crooked.
@export var aim_rotation: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO

## Whether aiming looks along an iron sight measured from the mesh and built on it (a notch
## at the rear, a ring round a post at the front; see `view/zee_iron_sight.gd`). When the
## view model can measure one, it replaces [member aim_offset] and [member aim_rotation]:
## the line through the two sights goes through the eye, so the front sight sits on the
## crosshair and the gun's top runs away below it. Off, or on a scoped weapon, or with no
## mesh to measure, aim is the written [member aim_offset] as before.
@export var iron_sight: bool = true

## Metres from the eye to the rear sight at full aim, before the view model pushes it out
## far enough that the gun's back end stays in front of the near plane.

## Seconds from hip to full aim (and back).

@export_group("Motion")

## The draw, as [ZeeWeaponPose] keys ([t, position, rotation degrees] from holstered at 0 to
## in hand at 1). Empty takes [constant ZeeWeaponPose.DRAW_KEYS].
@export var draw_keys: Array = []

## The reload, as [ZeeWeaponPose] keys over its fraction. Empty takes the pose's
## ([method ZeeWeaponArtTable.reload_keys]).
@export var reload_keys: Array = []

## Where the weapon sits relative to the character's hand attachment point.
@export var world_offset: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO

@export_range(0.05, 8.0, 0.01) var world_scale: float = 1.0

@export_group("Magazine")

## The magazine mesh, dropped and replaced during a reload. Empty means the reload is
## the weapon tipping out of frame and back, with nothing leaving it.
##
## [b]This kit ships the clip as a separate model[/b], which is the whole reason the
## reload animation is worth having: a magazine that visibly falls away and a fresh one
## that slides in is the difference between a reload the player can read and a gun that
## waggles for two seconds.
@export_file("*.glb", "*.gltf", "*.tscn", "*.scn") var magazine_path: String = ""

## Where the magazine sits in the weapon, in the weapon's own space.
@export var magazine_offset: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO

@export var magazine_rotation: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO

## The "magazine" is a loose round fed by hand (a shell, a cartridge, a grenade, a rocket):
## nothing drops out, it is drawn only while the support hand carries it in, and it is gone
## once it is in. A pack whose guns have no separate magazine still gets a hand that fetches
## something and puts it in the gun.
@export var magazine_loose: bool = false

@export_group("Attachments")

## Extra meshes parented to the weapon: a scope, a silencer, a drum.
##
## Each entry is `{"path": String, "offset": Vector3, "rotation": Vector3}`. A
## dictionary rather than a resource per attachment because an attachment is three
## values and a resource per scope would be sixty files to say what sixty lines say.
