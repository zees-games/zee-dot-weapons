## Which mesh each weapon wears, and where it sits in the hand and on the screen.
##
## [b]The only file in the pack that knows a filename.[/b] Everything else names a role
## — [constant ZeeWeaponIds.SNIPER], not `blaster-e.glb` — so a game that wants its own
## art replaces this one table and changes no rule, no loadout and no save. That is the
## same seam dot-fx draws between a catalogue and a scene, and dot-props between a
## definition and a script.
##
## [b]Built in code rather than as `.tres` files, and only because this is a pack.[/b]
## Every class here is `@tool`-annotated and inspector-editable, which is what a game
## with an artist wants. What a reference pack wants is the opposite: one file you can
## read top to bottom and see every weapon's placement with the reasoning beside it.
##
## [b]The roles were assigned from the models' measurements, not from their names.[/b]
## `blaster-a` through `blaster-r` are the order Kenney exported them in and say nothing
## about what they are. Each was measured — length, width, height — and given the role
## its silhouette can carry: the two widest became the revolver and the drum shotgun
## because width reads as a cylinder, the slimmest became the beam weapon, the 1.39 m
## one became the sniper, and the 0.42 m one became the derringer. A role assigned from
## a filename would have been a coin flip eighteen times.

# No CHANNEL: a table of filenames. validate() returns a DotResult for the caller to log,
# and the one runtime that can fail against the disk, ZeeModelCache, logs its own misses.

# --- Shared parts -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The kit ships these as separate models, which is the whole reason the reload and the
# attachment systems are worth having: a magazine that visibly falls out is readable in
# a way that a gun waggling for two seconds is not.

# --- Poses ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Five hand positions rather than twenty-seven. A pistol and a derringer are held the
# same way and differ by a centimetre nobody can see, so the offsets live here once and
# a weapon states which family it belongs to. The per-weapon nudges below are then only
# the ones that are actually about that weapon.

## Where a weapon of each pose sits relative to the camera.
##
## [b]Lower and further out than a real weapon would be, and smaller than one.[/b] These
## numbers are not anatomical, and the arithmetic says why. The camera runs at a
## 90-degree vertical field of view, so at 0.5 m the visible world is a metre tall — and
## a 0.7 m rifle held there at life size fills two thirds of the screen. Every game in
## this genre answers that by drawing the view model at a much narrower field of view
## than the world; a single camera cannot do that, so the equivalent is done here by
## shrinking the weapon, which produces the same angular size.
##
## See [method pose_scale] for the other half of the same decision.

## How a blaster of each pose is turned at the hip, in degrees (pitch, yaw, roll) in the
## model's own space (a blaster's is the view's: it points -Z): yaw positive brings the muzzle
## in toward the crosshair, roll positive cants the weapon's right side up toward the eye.
##
## [b]Canted and turned, because pointed straight down the view it is drawn end-on.[/b] A
## weapon below and right of the eye, pointing where the eye points, shows the camera its
## back face and a sliver of its left side: a stub in the corner, which is what this pack
## drew until the contact sheet put it beside a production shooter's. Perspective already
## carries a straight barrel toward the screen's centre; the yaw adds to that, and the cant
## is what turns the right side (the side with the detail) toward the eye. At this distance a
## right side needs about thirty degrees of cant before it faces the camera at all.

## How much a weapon of each pose is shrunk to stand in for a narrower field of view.
##
## [b]Roughly half, and it is not an arbitrary taste.[/b] A weapon drawn at life size
## half a metre from a 90-degree camera spans most of the screen; a watcher reads that as
## the gun being enormous rather than as the camera being wide. Halving it puts a rifle
## at about a third of the screen height, which is where this genre has settled. A heavy
## weapon is shrunk a little further because it is longer to begin with.

		# had it. Held slightly above life size is what a first-person blade looks like in
		# every game that ships one.
