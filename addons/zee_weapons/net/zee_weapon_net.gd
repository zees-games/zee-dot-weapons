## What has to travel so that somebody else's weapon looks right on your screen.
##
## [b]dot-weapon already replicates the simulation; this replicates the picture.[/b]
## [DotWeaponNetSync] sends the slot, the magazine and the reserve — everything needed to
## keep a carrier's state correct. None of that tells a watcher that a shot just
## happened, and a watcher who is not told sees a silent gun that never moves. So this
## adds four small fields on top, and a game concatenates the two spec lists.
##
## [b]A counter, not an event.[/b] The obvious design is an RPC per shot, and it is wrong
## in three ways that all show up at once: it needs a reliable channel for something that
## is worthless if it arrives late, it costs a packet per shot per watcher, and it
## desynchronises from the state snapshot it belongs with — so a watcher can see the
## muzzle flash of a weapon the same snapshot says has been holstered. A four-bit counter
## that lives [i]in[/i] the snapshot cannot do any of those: it arrives with the state it
## describes, it costs four bits, and a watcher who missed a snapshot sees the counter
## jump by two and plays one flash instead of two. Missing one flash out of forty in a
## burst nobody can count is the correct amount of wrong.
##
## [b]Ammunition stays owner-only, and that is not a bandwidth decision.[/b] Exact
## magazine and reserve counts are information an opponent should not have; sending them
## to everybody is how a modified client knows when to push. [DotWeaponNetSync] already
## makes that call and this changes none of it — what is added here is public because
## "that player is firing" is something anybody in the room can see anyway.
##
## [b]dot-net is not a dependency and is not named here[/b], the same rule dot-weapon and
## dot-combat both follow: a script that so much as mentions a `class_name` the project
## does not have fails to parse, and takes every script that references it down as well.
## So the bridge lives in the host game and this is everything it would otherwise have
## had to work out.

# No CHANNEL: a codec of static functions over snapshot fields, run per tick per watcher.
# A codec is silent; anything it could say would be once per snapshot.

## Bits in the fire counter. Four is sixteen shots between snapshots, which at 64 Hz is
## a weapon firing at 960 rounds a minute — the fastest thing in the pack is 1100, so a
## watcher of a minigun at full rate can miss one flash in a snapshot they already
## missed. Five bits would fix a case nobody can perceive.
