extends RefCounted

## What each weapon sounds like, baked from arithmetic the first time it is asked for.
##
## [b]Baked, because the pack ships no audio and every game built on it was silent.[/b] The
## art is CC0 and vendored; there is no CC0 set of twenty-seven matched weapon sounds to
## vendor beside it, and a pack that left sound to each game got none in any of them. A
## synthesised shot is a stand-in, but it is the stand-in that tells a player the trigger
## did something — the one thing a silent weapon cannot.
##
## [b]Why not dot-audio's synthesiser.[/b] It is one sine sweep with unfiltered noise and
## three shot voices, which is right for what it is (a placeholder for every kind of sound
## a game makes) and wrong for this: twenty-seven weapons need a crack, a body and a tail
## that can be told apart, and white noise with nothing filtered out of it is a hiss rather
## than a report. So the layers here are filtered, and the pack depends on nothing new.
##
## [b]Replaced one id at a time.[/b] [method set_stream] puts a real recording in front of
## the synthesiser, so a game that gets audio for its rifle does not have to re-record the
## rest before it can use it.
##
## [b]Deterministic.[/b] The grit is [method DotRandomStream.mix4] rather than [method
## @GlobalScope.randf], so every machine bakes the same bytes, which is what lets the suite
## assert about a sound instead of listening to one.

## 22 kHz mono, for the reason dot-audio gives: short noises with nothing worth keeping
## above a few kilohertz, at half the memory of 44.
const RATE := 22050

## Sound classes. A weapon names one; a game can override per weapon id instead.

## How each class is built. Every field is optional; the defaults are silence.
##
## [code]crack[/code] is the supersonic snap: band-passed noise, [code]crack_hz[/code] its
## top, decaying over [code]crack_s[/code]. [code]body[/code] is the thump the chest hears:
## a sine swept from [code]body_hz[/code] down to [code]body_to[/code] over
## [code]body_s[/code]. [code]tail[/code] is the room: darker noise that rings out over
## [code]tail_s[/code]. [code]tone[/code] is a pitched zap, for the energy weapons, swept
## [code]tone_hz[/code] to [code]tone_to[/code]. [code]whoosh[/code] is air: noise whose
## brightness rises and falls over the whole sound, for anything swung or thrown.
##
## [b]One table, so the classes can be read against each other.[/b] Whether a sniper is
## louder than a pistol is a question about two rows, and two rows side by side is the
## only way it gets checked.
