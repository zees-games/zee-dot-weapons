## The hands holding the weapon, in first person.
##
## [b]Two meshes lifted out of a whole character, not an arms model.[/b] Kenney's blocky
## characters are six rigid parts — head, torso, two arms, two legs — and the two arms
## are usable on their own, which is the only reason this pack has first-person hands at
## all without anybody modelling any. Everything else in the character is deleted on
## load, because a torso at the camera's own position fills the screen with somebody's
## chest.
##
## [b]All eighteen characters share byte-identical arm geometry and differ only by a
## texture atlas[/b], so a game changing whose hands these are changes one texture path
## and no mesh. That is why [member skin] is a path and not a model.
##
## [b]Poses are hand-authored numbers, and they are numbers because there is no rig.[/b]
## These arms have no skeleton and no animation track — they are rigid boxes on a
## transform each. So a "pose" here is a position and a rotation per arm, which is
## enough for the four ways this pack holds things and is honestly all the kit can
## support. A game with a skinned first-person rig replaces this node entirely; the
## view model only requires that something answers [method set_pose].

## The atlas painted onto them. Empty keeps whatever the model shipped with.
##
## [b]This is how the hands match the player.[/b] Every atlas in the kit shares one UV
## layout, so swapping it recolours the sleeves and the skin and nothing else needs
## touching — which is what lets a game hand a player's own avatar texture straight in.

## Scale of the arms.
##
## [b]0.20, and it is set by reach rather than by taste.[/b] Measured, the blocky
## character is **2.7 m tall** — a stylised giant, not a person — and one arm is a
## 0.4 x 1.1 x 0.4 box. The shoulders below sit about 0.35 m out and 0.35 m down; the
## weapon's grip is about 0.45 m out and 0.17 m down. A fifth of a metre is the distance
## between those two points, so it is the length the arm has to be.
##
## [b]Thickness is why this cannot simply be made bigger.[/b] The box is 0.4 wide in its
## own units, so the scale sets the forearm's thickness as well as its length: at 0.20 an
## arm is 8 cm across, which at a third of a metre from a 90-degree camera is about a
## seventh of the screen. At 0.36 it was 14 cm at 0.1 m out — the whole screen — and the
## render was two cream slabs with the rifle somewhere behind them.

# --- Poses ------------------------------------------------------------------

## Where each arm's SHOULDER sits, and which way the arm points from it.
##
## [b]These are shoulders, not hands, and the mesh is why.[/b] Measured, an arm in this
## kit is a 0.4 x 1.1 x 0.4 box whose origin sits at the [i]top[/i] of it: the mesh runs
## from y=0 down to y=-1. So the transform below places the shoulder and the hand follows
## an arm's length away in whatever direction the rotation points.
##
## [b]The pitch is positive, and that is the whole of the first attempt being wrong.[/b]
## Rotating the arm by +90 degrees about X takes its local "down" onto Godot's forward,
## which is an arm held out in front of you. Negative takes it onto backward — an arm
## pointing behind the camera. Seventy-odd degrees is forward and slightly down, which is
## where a hand on a grip actually is.
##
## [b]Every shoulder is in FRONT of the camera, and anatomy is the trap.[/b] A real
## shoulder is behind the eye, so the natural z here is positive — and a positive z puts
## the shoulder behind the near clip plane, which does not hide the arm. It slices it,
## and what draws is the cut face: a pale slab across the lower half of the screen that
## reads as a broken model rather than as a clipping plane. Every z below is negative,
## and the arm simply starts where the player can see it.
##
## [b]The yaws are mirrored, and getting the signs the wrong way round splays the arms
## outward across the gun[/b] instead of bringing them in under it. The left arm reaches
## right (negative yaw) and the right arm reaches left (positive), because both hands are
## converging on one weapon held slightly right of centre.
##
## [b]How these were derived, so the next person can redo them rather than nudge them.[/b]
## Each pair is a shoulder and a hand: the hand is where the weapon's grip and fore-end
## actually are (see [method ZeeWeaponArtTable.pose_offset]), the shoulder is placed low
## and about 0.3 m out, and the rotation is the one that points the arm from the first at
## the second — pitch from the vertical rise, yaw from the sideways offset.
## [member arm_scale] is then the distance between them.
##
## [b]The pitches are past 90 degrees, and that is a forearm, not a mistake.[/b] The
## shoulder is below the weapon and the hand is above it, so the arm rises as it goes
## forward — which is what a hand coming up from the bottom of the screen onto a grip
## looks like. Under 90 the arm would go forward and down, out of frame.
##
## [b]The right hand is on the grip and the left is further out on the fore-end[/b],
## which is what makes a two-handed weapon read as two-handed. A pistol brings the left
## hand in to meet the right rather than removing it, because a single floating arm reads
## as a bug rather than as a stance.
