## The weapon everybody [i]else[/i] sees, hanging off a character's hand.
##
## [b]Not a second copy of [ZeeViewModel], and the difference is the point.[/b] A view
## model is drawn on top of the world at an exaggerated scale, sways with the camera and
## exists for exactly one viewer. A world model is an object in the world: it is
## depth-tested, it casts a shadow, it is the right size, and thirty of them can be on
## screen at once. Sharing one node between the two jobs means either a first-person
## weapon that clips through walls or a third-person weapon somebody can see through a
## floor.
##
## [b]It is attached by duck typing, never by class.[/b] `attach_to` takes any node that
## answers `attachment(point)` — which dot-player-char's visual does and a game's own rig
## can — and this file mentions no character class at all, because a script that
## references a `class_name` the project does not have fails to parse and takes every
## script that references [i]it[/i] down with it.
##
## [b]Recoil is smaller here and that is deliberate.[/b] The kick a player feels in their
## own hands is a feel effect tuned for one viewer; applied at full strength to a
## character twenty metres away it reads as the weapon coming loose. A fraction of it is
## enough to tell a watcher that the gun went off.

# No CHANNEL: a drawer. Its one failure, a model that will not load, is reported once by
# ZeeModelCache and handed back as a DotResult; "nowhere to attach" is headless, not wrong.

# [b]A swing and a throw are keys here too, for the view model's reason[/b] ([ZeeWeaponPose]'s

# slash rigid in the hand, pointing where the held-gun pose points, and a grenade thrown from a
# hand that never moved. Each key is [t, position in metres, rotation in degrees (pitch up,
# yaw left, roll counter-clockwise)] in the hand's frame (-Z the way the person faces, +Y up),
# turned about the grip, on top of [method ZeeWeaponArt.world_transform], read through
# [method ZeeWeaponPose.sample_keys]. [b]Not the view model's keys[/b]: those are in the camera's
# frame at the view model's scale, and the arm under this one already moves (the person's
# slash overlay), so these are the wrist's share only: cocked back as the arm comes up, cut
# through as it comes down, followed through and back.

## A melee swing, timed to the person's slash overlay (the arm is up at about 0.12 s and through
## by 0.3 s at the rate the family plays it).

## the person's: a thrown weapon is held with empty-handed arms, which have no throw of their
## own, so [method throw] asks the person it hangs from for the slash overlay (see
## [method _person]): up past the head and over, an overhand throw's path. Without an arm under
