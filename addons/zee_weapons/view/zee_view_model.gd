## The weapon you see in your own hands, and everything it does while you hold it.
##
## Parent it to the camera. It builds the arms once, swaps the weapon model whenever the
## arsenal switches, and every render frame asks [ZeeWeaponPose] where the thing should
## actually be.
##
## [b]It is told what happened; it never asks.[/b] Nothing here reads an input device, a
## clock or the arsenal's internals — a game calls [method on_used],
## [method on_reload_started] and the rest from the signals it is already handling. That
## is what lets exactly the same node draw a remote player's weapon in third person,
## driven by replicated events rather than by local ones, with no branch anywhere in it.
##
## [b]Nothing here is part of the netcode contract.[/b] It runs on render frames, never
## writes to the simulation, and a player who turns it off simulates identically to one
## who does not — which is the whole reason dot-player-controller keeps its view in a
## separate node, and this is the same line drawn in the same place.
##
## [b]Structure, and why it is four nodes deep.[/b]
## [codeblock]
## ZeeViewModel          at the camera, identity
##   Arms                the hands, posed per weapon
##   Animated            the pose's transform: sway, bob, kick, deploy
##     Holder            the art's resting transform: offset, orientation, scale
##       Weapon          the mesh, in its own +Z-forward space
##       Magazine        a sibling, so a reload can animate it independently
##       Attachment(s)   siblings too, in the same model space
## [/codeblock]
## The split between Animated and Holder is what lets the art's placement and the frame's
## animation be authored independently: fold them together and every weapon's resting
## offset has to be re-derived every time the sway changes.

## The vertical field of view, in degrees, the hands are drawn at whatever the camera's is.

## [b]Why the hands have a lens of their own.[/b] Every pose in [ZeeWeaponArtTable] was set
## under a 90-degree camera, and the games hold them under 83, 92 and 100: through a wider
## lens the same pose is a smaller gun drifting toward the middle of the screen, through a
## narrower one a bigger gun pushed to the edge, and a zoom to aim magnified the gun with
## the world. This genre draws the hands at a fixed field of view for exactly that reason.
##
## [b]Done with a scale, not a second camera.[/b] Scaling the view model's X and Y by
## `tan(camera / 2) / tan(this / 2)` in the camera's own space, with Z left alone, gives
## every vertex the screen position it would have under this lens -- exactly, because a
## perspective projection divides X and Y by Z and nothing else. Depth is untouched, so the
## hands still sort against the world the way they did, and the muzzle a tracer starts from
## is read through the same transform, so a shot still leaves the drawn barrel.
