extends RefCounted

## Turns what the keyboard and mouse are doing into a [DotWeaponCommand].
##
## [b]The only file in the pack that touches an input device, and it is deliberately the
## only one.[/b] Everything downstream — the rig, the arsenal, every behaviour — is a
## pure function of the command this produces, which is what lets a server re-run a
## client's shot and reach the same answer, and what lets a bot, a replay and a headless
## test drive exactly the same code by building a command by hand.
##
## [b]Sampled on a render frame, consumed on a tick.[/b] A button pressed and released
## between two ticks would be missed entirely by code that read the device on the tick,
## which is the classic dropped-shot bug in every fixed-timestep game. So presses are
## latched here as they arrive and cleared when the command is taken.
##
## [b]Yaw and pitch are copied from the movement command, never sampled again.[/b] Two
## samples of the same mouse a frame apart differ, and a shot fired along an angle the
## movement never had is a shot that leaves the muzzle somewhere the player was not
## looking. [method set_aim] is how that is done.

## tick after the tap even though it is no longer down — so both go in, and the arsenal's
## own edge detection against the previous command sorts out which is which.

## return, which reads as the game firing by itself.

# --- Default bindings -------------------------------------------------------

## Registers bindings for any of the actions above the project does not already define.

## bound it on purpose, and an addon that overwrote it at startup would be an addon that
## silently un-configures the project it is installed into. Returns how many it added.
##
## [b]Logged at INFO when it adds anything, and silent when it adds nothing.[/b] It
## changes the project's input map at startup, and "why does R reload when my game never
## bound it" has no other answer anywhere in the process. A second call adds nothing and
## says nothing, so it cannot turn into a line per scene change.
