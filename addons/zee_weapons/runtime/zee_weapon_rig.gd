## One player's weapons: the arsenal, the bash, the view model and the world model,
## driven from one command a tick.
##
## [b]This is the node a game adds, and ideally the only one.[/b] Everything under it is
## wired together here because the wiring is the part every game gets subtly wrong: the
## arsenal has to be simulated before the presentation is updated, the presentation has
## to be skipped during a replay, the bash has to roll back with everything else, and the
## view model has to be told how far through a switch it is by somebody who is counting.
## Four rules, none of them obvious, all of them silent when broken.
##
## [codeblock]
## var outcome := rig.simulate_tick(command, tick)
## for shot in outcome.shots:
##     combat.resolve(shot)          # the game's, on the authority only
## [/codeblock]
##
## [b]The same node runs in all three roles.[/b] A server simulating thirty carriers, a
## client predicting its own, and a client drawing somebody else's are the same code with
## [member role] set differently — because the moment they are three code paths, two of
## them are wrong and nobody notices until a player reports that hit registration feels
## bad. What the role changes is only what is [i]drawn[/i]: a server draws nothing, a
## remote player has no view model, and a local player has both.
